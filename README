This is the Pyomo optimisation model for the paper titled "An MINLP-based decision-making tool 
to help microbreweries improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon footprint through retrofits"

In addition to the modules listed at the start of the main file, you need the following to run:
    Files named "Autumn1.csv", "Spring1.csv", "Summer1.csv" and "Winter1.csv" - contain irradiance data
    A file named "Windspeeddata.csv" - contains wind speed data
    A file named "load_demand.xlsx" - contains the energy loads on the boiler

The data provided in this repository is from the case study described in section 3 of the paper
